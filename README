Ruby2Make
---------

* Goal: Ruby DSL to generate Makefiles

* Status: Pretty much a literal translation right now - though it does
          sort of work (see below example)

To make this Makefile:

    CC = gcc
    FLAGS = -g

    hello: hello.o
        $(CC) $(FLAGS) hello.o -o hello
        @echo "Run ./hello"

    hello.o: hello.c hello.h
        $(CC) $(FLAGS) hello.c -c

    clean:
        -rm hello *.o

Use this script:

    vars :CC => "gcc", :FLAGS => "-g"

    rule "hello", :depends => "hello.o" do
        compile :output => "hello"
        echo "Run ./hello"
    end

    rule "hello.o" do
        depend "hello.c", "hello.h"
        compile :to_obj
    end

    clean "hello", "*.o"
 
It's more readable, and it doesn't insanely require tabs and not spaces.
