* Figure out a good way to include lots of files (as in both goals)
  - Perhaps just use normal Ruby:
        vars :OFILES => Dir['*.o']

* Special macros - $@, $<, etc

* method_missing for shell commands?

* Figure out a better form of the suffix rule than using a literal command 

* Add :silent ('@') and something to suppress errors ('-') when adding commands

* Fix rules so that commands/compiles/etc in rules occur in the same order as
  specified in the Makefile.rb (they currently don't, as compiles have a higher
  priority)
